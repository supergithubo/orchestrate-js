# ðŸ“¹ Image-to-Video Helper Workflow

Easily turn a still image into a cinematic video animation using AI. This example workflow is perfect for creators, artists, and developers who want to:

- Generate a detailed video prompt from an input image using GPT-4o Vision
- Automatically create a video animation with RunwayML's Gen-2 model
- Retain the hand-drawn aesthetic and vibrant colors of the original image
- Save the resulting video locally for further use

## What This Workflow Does

1. **Describe the Image**  
   Uses OpenAI Vision (GPT-4o) to analyze your image and generate a cinematic video prompt tailored to the content and style of the input.

2. **Generate Video from Image**  
   Sends the prompt and input image to RunwayML's Gen-2 image-to-video API, producing a short animation that matches the described mood and style.

3. **Save Output**  
   Downloads the generated video to a local directory for easy access and sharing.

## Commands and Models Used

- Image Description: OpenAI Vision (`gpt-4o`)
- Video Generation: RunwayML Gen-2 (`gen4_turbo`)
