# ðŸ§  How to Prompt If You Can't Imagine Anything

_Suppose you are a dumb person who can't imagine, so you just ask:_

> **"I'm a dumb user that can't imagine anything. Make me an image prompt about the sky."**

This example demonstrates how to automate prompt generation, image creation using multiple models, and AI-driven evaluation â€” without needing to think creatively.

## ðŸ¤– What This Workflow Does

1. **Ask GPT for a prompt**  
   You give GPT-4o-mini a simple message saying you can't imagine anything and want a prompt about "the sky". GPT will generate a detailed prompt for you.

2. **Generate images using DALLÂ·E models in parallel**  
   Using both `dall-e-3` and `dall-e-2`, the prompt is used to create two different images at the same time â€” because you don't know which model will do a better job.

3. **Download both images**  
   Once the images are generated (as URLs), they are downloaded into a local folder (`/tmp`), so they can be processed further.

4. **Analyze the results with OpenAI Vision**  
   GPT-4o (with vision capabilities) compares the two images side by side. It tells you:
   - Which one matches the prompt better
   - Which one looks more realistic
   - And **why**

## ðŸ§± Commands and Models Used

- OpenAI APIs
  - Chat Response: `gpt-4o-mini`
  - Image Generation: `dall-e-3`, `dall-e-2`
  - Image Analysis: `gpt-4o`
- HTTP Image Download: `axios`
